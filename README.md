# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Digit Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for digit classification and to verify the response for scanned handwritten images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
Digit categorization of scanned handwriting images, together with answer verification. There are a number of handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. The assignment is to place a handwritten digit picture into one of ten classes that correspond to integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively. The dataset consists of 60,000 handwritten digits that are each 28 by 28 pixels in size. In this case, we construct a convolutional neural network model that can categorise to the relevant numerical value.
